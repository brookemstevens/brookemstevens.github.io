I am a Data Science graduate student at <b>Northeastern University</b> specializing in Deep Learning and Computer Vision. I'm currently enrolled in subjects: CS 5800: Algorithms and CS 7150: Deep Learning.

Prior to joining Northeastern University, I gained valuable industry experience as a <b>Data Engineer<b> at [Dataweave](https://dataweave.com/), an e-commerce analytics company for 2.5 years. In this role, I was initially involved in <b>Data scraping</b> and <b>Data Wrangling</b> from major e-commerce websites. As I progressed, I transitioned into <b>automation of data workflows</b> using technologies like <b>Apache Airflow</b> and <b>Amazon Web Services</b>. This hands-on experience allowed me to witness the direct application of Data Science in solving real-world problems.

During my tenure, I had the privilege of working with a talented team to integrate the [Dask](https://www.dask.org/) framework into our company's clustering algorithm. This groundbreaking implementation resulted in a remarkable <b>50% reduction</b> in batch processing time of text and image data. I take immense pride in this accomplishment, as it exemplifies my innovative problem-solving abilities and collaborative approach.

I completed my undergraduate in Information Science at [BMS College of Engineering](https://www.bmsce.ac.in/), graduating in the <b>top 10%</b> of the class of 2020. My research interests include Neural Networks and Computer Vision. At BMSCE, I was a <b>senior coordinator</b> for the ISE Student Club and served as the <b>Technical mentor</b> between 2019-2020. From a cultural standpoint, I served as the <b>Coordinator and Head</b> of the publicity and sponsorship teams for the BMSCE's annual technial symposium, [PhaseShift](https://www.instagram.com/bmsce_phaseshift/?hl=en) between 2018-2019.

Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy staying active and exploring the outdoors. Whether it's playing badminton or embarking on a scenic trail hike, I find solace in the balance between mental and physical well-being. 

Looking ahead, I am eager to combine the comprehensive skills in Data Science, encompassing Machine Learning, Statistics, and Algorithms, that I am acquiring at the university with my prior industry experience. My ultimate goal is to tackle <b>complex real-world data science problems</b> and make a meaningful impact.
