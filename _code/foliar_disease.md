## Summary
---

The objective of the project was to train a model using images of the training dataset to accurately classify a given image from the testing dataset into different diseased categories or a healthy leaf. A vanilla CNN model served as an optimum solution for the problem statement and use case. After implementation, the model was accurately able to differentiate the test images into a diseased category or a healthy leaf.
