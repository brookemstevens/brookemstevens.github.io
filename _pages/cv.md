## Academic Projects
---

**US Air Pollution Time Series Analysis**<br>
Northeastern University, DS 5110<br>
<ul><li>Applied time-series analysis techniques to the US pollution dataset, by focusing on significant pollutants.</li><br>
<li>Leveraged advanced time-series forecasting approaches (SARIMAX, LSTM) to predict future air pollution trends in California, providing valuable data-driven insights for environmental monitoring and strategic decision-making.</li></ul><br>

**Trending News Prediction using NLTK and Web Scraping**<br>
<ul><li>Developed a web scraper to gather news articles from a specific website and processed the data using NLP techniques.</li><br>
<li>Employed various classification machine learning models (logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest, xgboost) to determine the optimal model for predicting and analyzing news trends.</li></ul><br>

**Deep Learning Approaches to Detect Pneumonia**<br>
BMS College of Engineering<br>
<ul><li>Ran a comparative analysis of three machine learning models (CNN, U-Net, Mask-RCNN) for pneumonia detection.</li><br>
<li>Achieved accurate identification and precise localization of pneumonia infection regions in Chest Radiographs by leveraging the superior performance of the Mask-RCNN model.</li></ul><br>

**Foliar Disease Detection using CNN**<br>
<ul><li>The Objective of the project was to train a model using images of the training dataset to accurately classify a given image from the testing dataset into different diseased categories or a healthy leaf.</li><br>
<li>A vanilla CNN model served as an optimum solution for the problem statement and use case. After implementation, the model was accurately able to differentiate the test images into a diseased category or a healthy leaf.</li></ul><br>

**Deep Learning approach to detect distracted drivers**<br>
BMS College of Engineering<br>
<ul><li>Developed and evaluated multiple variations of a CNN deep learning model to detect distracted drivers, achieving accurate results and high efficiency through optimization and transfer learning techniques.</li><br>
<li>Successfully implemented a final model that accurately identified the driver's activity with high accuracy using the optimized CNN model and transfer learning approach.</li></ul><br>

**K.Rakshak** et al.<br>
A two-phase model is proposed that deals with the e-waste effectively. The end goal is to use technology on both the hardware and software side to minimize pollution, increase energy efficiency, and also encourage material recycling. The usage and benefits of Eco-ATMs are explored in this paper.<br>
